| [osTicket installer](https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Getting%20Started/Installation.html?highlight=installer#using-installation-script) | The osTicket installer is a web-based script that guides you through the initial setup of the help desk. It is launched by browsing to the osTicket URL after the files have been uploaded to the server. It performs prerequisite checks, creates the database, and writes the configuration file. |
| [help topics](https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Manage/Help%20Topic.html) | Pre-defined categories that helps streamline the ticket creation process. When a user selects a Help Topic, it can automatically route the ticket to the correct department and assign a priority, ensuring that it is handled by the appropriate agents with the correct urgency. |
| [teams](https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Agents/Teams.html) | A group of agents from one or more departments, created to handle specific issues or tickets. This allows for cross-departmental collaboration on a particular topic or type of ticket. |
| [users](https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Settings/Users.html?highlight=users) | End-users of the osTicket help desk, such as a customer or client. They can create tickets to get support and, depending on the system's settings, may need to register an account to do so. When a user is not registered, they can still check a ticket's status by using their email address and the ticket number. |
| [roles](https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Admin/Agents/Roles.html?highlight=roles) |  Defined permissions and access levels for an agent within osTicket. These are configured for each department an agent has access to, giving you granular control over what an agent can do, such as assigning tickets, editing tasks, or managing the knowledge base. An unlimited number of roles can be created and assigned to agents within departments.|
| [tasks](https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Agent/Tasks/Tasks.html?highlight=task) | An internal work item that can be created and assigned to an agent or a team. Unlike a ticket, a task is not visible to the end-user and is used as an internal "to-do list" to break down complex issues. A task can be created as a standalone item or, more commonly, as a sub-component of a ticket which can't be closed until all of its associated tasks are completed. |
| [tickets](https://docs.osticket.com/en/latest/Agent/Tickets/Tickets.html?highlight=ticket) | A ticket is the central unit for managing a support request in osTicket. It is created by a user (a customer or client) via email, a web form, or a phone call. The ticket serves as a complete record of the issue, including all communication between the user and the agent, and its resolution. All support inquiries are converted into tickets and archived in one place for easy management. |
