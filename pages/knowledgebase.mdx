# Building a Knowledgebase

A knowledgebase is a great way to generate resources for your agents and potentially for end-users as well. This can reduce ticket resolution time or even help users resolve issues on their own.

## Creating FAQs

**FAQs are articles** that can be accessed by agents or even users if properly configured. They contain important information regarding your organization or product.

<Steps>

### Enable the Knowledgebase
 
In the Admin panel, go to `Settings > Knowledgebase{:markdown}` and turn on "Enable Knowledge Base."

Click "Save Changes."

Click "Add New Category"

### Create Your First Article

Despite the name, **osTicket FAQs don't need to stick to a question-answer format**. They can be fully-fledged articles with diverse elements like subsections, images and tables.

Articles can be created using the editor or with standard HTML.

Build your article, then scroll down to the bottom and click "Add FAQ".
