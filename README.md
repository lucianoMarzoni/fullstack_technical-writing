# Nextra Docs Template 

This is the initial template to perform the technical writing test at FullStack Labs using the [Nextra](https://nextra.site) documentation framework. This framework is an open-source project that is widely used for all kinds of software and product documentation. 

If you would like to see an exmaple of it, you can check out Nextra's [**Live Demo â†’**](https://nextra-docs-template.vercel.app).

## Quick Start

To begin the test, you must fork this repository and perform the following tasks.

1. Select a poorly documented product as the documentation target.

2. Introduce a project name and logo at the top left of the page where it says "My Project".

3. Document at least 5 features, processes or elements of the product you selected using images or any other graphic you wish you introduce (you may use the pre-established pages or re-arrange the structure as necessary.)

    - You can add hyperlinks, images, code blocks, etc.
    - You must add a tab favicon to the documentation.
    - You can change the links on the top navigation bar to any relevant links.

4. Commit the changes to your forked repository and notify your Talent Acquisition Specialist to begin the review process.


## Local Development

1. Clone your forked copy of the repository to your local machine and open the project on the text editor of your choice (Atom, VS Code, etc.)

2. Once you have the project set up in your text editor, open a new terminal in the project directory and run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

2. Then, run `npm run dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000 in your browser to see your changes.
